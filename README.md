# lethal-company-set-sell-time-mod
Lethal Company Mod which speeds up scrap selling time, so you don't have to wait that long. It reduces the *sell time* and the *assess time* as well.
The *sell time* (the amount of time you have to wait before the company creature takes the scrap) is configurable between 1 and 10 seconds, the default is 2 seconds.
